\section{Memory Hierarchy}


Memory Hierarchy can be used to discuss performance issues in computer programs.
Throughout this course, an emphasis is made on the time and work complexity of
algorithms, however there are other factors that can affect real world performance of
processes executing different algorithms. After an algorithm is implemented,
it is important to verify cache behavior and other lower level.

From faster to slower the memory hierarchy follows:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Processor Registers
	\item Processor caches (L1, L2, L3, \ldots)
	\item Main memory
	\item Disk
\end{itemize}

Accessing data on a lower level in the above hierarchy orders of magnitude of slowdown.

\section{PRAM}
PRAM is the parallel analogous to RAM for parallel algorithm. It is
assumed to be shared by more than one processor, and at any point in
time a processor can read or write to any memory location.

\begin{figure}[!ht]
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.6]{memory.eps}
\caption{A PRAM representation}
\end{figure}


All processors work in lock-step. Occasionally, a "BARRIER" instruction
is needed, this is similar tu syncThreads() in CUDA.

In PRAM, the following are valid Read/write conflict resolution strategies:

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|p{8cm}|}
	\hline
	EREW & Exclusive Reads Exclusive Writes & Most flexible. Every memory location can be read or written to by only one processor at the time. Algorithms designed for this conflict strategy, work for all conflict strategies. \\ \hline
	CREW & Concurrent Reads Exclusive Writes & Closest to reality. \\ \hline
	ERCW & Exclusive Reads Concurrent Writes & Not interesting. \\  \hline
	CRCW & Concurrent Reads Concurrent Writes & Fastest model. \\ \hline
\end{tabular}

For concurrent writes, PRAM can be further defined as:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Arbitrary: Choose arbitrarily when two concurrent writes are performed to the same memory location
	\item Common: All processors must write the same value.
	\item Priority: Processor id is used to resolve conflicts.
\end{itemize}

\section{Network}

In a parallel computing system, there are several types of Network topologies that
can be used.

\begin{itemize}
 \item Mesh: data is transmited at 1 unit per hop
 \item Torus: Mesh with wraparound link at the edges
 \item Completely connected: Not efficient or scalable.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Hypercube}

In a hypercube with $n ^d$ nodes, the maximum distance between two nodes is
$ d $.

If each node can be labeled by a $d$-bit string, two nodes are connected if they differ in exactly
$1$ bit.

\begin{figure}[!ht]
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.3]{cube.eps}
\caption{An 8 node hypercube with $d = 3 $}
\end{figure}

\section{Scalability}
\subsection{Strong Scalability}
As the number of cores increases, the time taken to solve the same problem decreases.

\subsection{Weak Scalability}
For the same problem $ problemSize / numberOfCores = Constant $

\subsection{Amadahl's Law}
Amadahl's law is used to calculate the maximum speedup possible by improving the parallel portion
of an algorithm. Assume a program can be divided into sequential part $s$ and non-sequential part
$ 1 - s $, and $n$ is the number of processors. Then, the speedup can be given by:

\begin{align*}
 speedup &= \frac{T_{seq}}{T_{parallel}}\\
 T_{parallel} &\geq s(T_{seq}) + \frac{(1 - s) T_{seq}}{n} \\
 T_{parallel} &\geq (s + \frac{1 -s }{n}) T_{seq} \\
 \frac{T_{seq}}{T_{parallel}} &\leq \frac{1}{s + \frac{1 - s}{n}}
\end{align*}


\subsection{Gustafson's Law}

Gustafson argues that the problem size is not constant and if the parallel portion of a program is improved,
the problem size may also be increased, while solving the problem in the same time.

\section{Programming Languages}

In class, we briefly went over the following example programs (found in the course's github page).

\begin{itemize}
 \item FooBar.java
 \item Fibonacci1.java
 \item Fibonacci2.java
 \item Fibonacci3.java
\end{itemize}
